            Happy 17th Birthday, Maysoon ü•≥  
            <br/><br/>
            I‚Äôve said this before but I‚Äôll say it again, you really do make me want to be a better version of myself. Like in every way. With deen, with school, with how I treat people, with everything.   
            <br/><br/>
            You‚Äôre the only person I could ever truthfully see myself with. That‚Äôs not even something I‚Äôm confused about. No one else has made me feel that way.  
            <br/><br/>
            I know things haven‚Äôt always been easy, especially with moving and everything in Egypt. But I‚Äôve seen how you‚Äôve adapted and handled it all, and I just want to say I‚Äôm proud of you. Seriously. That takes strength.  
            <br/><br/>
            You‚Äôre not just funny or smart or artistic or anything like that. You‚Äôre genuinely someone who inspires me. And even if I‚Äôm all the way here and you're all the way there, I still wanted to make this and show that I‚Äôm always rooting for you.  
            <br/><br/>
            I hope this year brings you peace, happiness, and more of the good stuff you deserve. You‚Äôve earned it.
