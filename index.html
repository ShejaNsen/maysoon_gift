            Happy 17th Birthday, Maysoon 🥳  
            <br/><br/>
            I’ve said this before but I’ll say it again — you really do make me want to be a better version of myself. Like in every way. With deen, with school, with how I treat people, with everything. Just knowing you pushes me to level up.  
            <br/><br/>
            You’re the only person I could ever truthfully see myself with. That’s not even something I’m confused about. No one else has made me feel that way.  
            <br/><br/>
            I know things haven’t always been easy, especially with moving and everything in Egypt. But I’ve seen how you’ve adapted and handled it all, and I just want to say I’m proud of you. Seriously. That takes strength. And I respect that.  
            <br/><br/>
            You’re not just funny or smart or artistic or anything like that. You’re genuinely someone who inspires me. And even if I’m all the way here and you're all the way there, I still wanted to make this and show that I’m always rooting for you.  
            <br/><br/>
            I hope this year brings you peace, happiness, and more of the good stuff you deserve. You’ve earned it.

                Now blow the candle and make a du’a.
